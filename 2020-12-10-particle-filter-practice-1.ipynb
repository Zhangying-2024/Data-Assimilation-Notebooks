    "You are monitoring air temperature in Grenoble, with some model and a thermometer installed on the top of your roof. Your 6-member ensemble simulation provides temperature of 8, 8.7, 9.3, 9.5, 9.8, 10.2 . And your thermometer provides an observation of 9.25. You estimate the standard deviation of the thermometer uncertainty at 0.25. This incertainty is assumed Gaussian.\n",
