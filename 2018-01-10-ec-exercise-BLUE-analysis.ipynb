    "We are interested in the estimation of [Tg, Tc], air temperature in Grenoble and Chambéry. We have prior estimations equal to [10, 5]. These estimations are contaminated by errors, which standard deviation is 1°C for both. Based on past studies, we also estimate that these prior estimation errors in Grenoble and Chambéry are correlated with coefficient 0.25.\n",
